Designing your portfolio should feel like designing *you* — structured, creative, and personal.

---

## 🧠 The Vision

I didn’t want another cookie-cutter dev portfolio.  
I wanted something that says:

> “This guy loves what he does — and it shows.”

---

## 🛠️ The Stack

- **Vue 3** + **Nuxt 3**
- **Tailwind CSS** for design
- **Trois.js** for animated 3D models
- **Markdown** for easy blog posts (like this one!)

---

## 🎨 Design Goals

- Show personality, but keep it clean
- Use animations subtly (like a floating keyboard on the homepage)
- Stick to my brand colors (`#132534`, `#faa2a2`, `#6eb1e7`)
- Make the transitions *buttery smooth*

---

## 🚧 Challenges I Faced

- **3D integration** was tricky — GLTF loading needed optimization
- Page transitions needed manual hooks
- Balancing visuals with performance wasn’t easy

---

## 💡 What I’d Improve Next Time

- Use `Nuxt Content` or `contentlayer` earlier for markdown
- Add Framer Motion for richer animations
- Build components more modular from the start

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

Your portfolio isn’t just a place to list skills.  
It’s your **digital personality**.

Build it in a way that makes people say: _“Whoa, I want to hire this person.”_
