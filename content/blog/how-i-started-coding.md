We all start somewhere — my journey into coding began not with a course or a job, but with curiosity.

## 🧒 My First Lines of Code

Like many, I first touched code through **modding games** and customizing websites. I didn’t know it was called "coding"
back then.  
All I knew was: _“If I change this… that changes on screen. That’s cool!”_

From there, I picked up HTML and CSS. Eventually, JavaScript followed — and with it came **projects**.

## 🚀 The Turning Point

In secondary school, I enrolled in an ICT track. That’s when I realized:

> “This isn’t just fun. I’m actually *good* at this.”

The satisfaction of solving bugs, building something visual, and seeing it _work_ — that never gets old.

## 🔁 Why I Still Code

I keep coding because:

- It’s creative and logical at the same time
- It gives me control over what I build
- I love making real things that people can use

Sometimes I burn out. But after a break, I always return. That’s how I know it’s real.

## 🧪 What Keeps Me Inspired

- Other developers' portfolios
- Seeing someone use something I built
- Learning a new tool (Vue, Tailwind, etc.)
- Thinking _“I can make this better.”_

## 👋 Final Thoughts

If you’re starting out: stay curious.  
If you’re feeling stuck: go back to why you started.

We don’t just write code — we build ideas.
