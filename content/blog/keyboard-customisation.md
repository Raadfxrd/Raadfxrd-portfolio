Most people settle for the keyboard they’re given.  
But customizing your setup can transform your entire computing experience — whether you're a developer, gamer, writer,
or just someone who types a lot.

---

## 🔧 Why Customize?

A stock keyboard is like a stock car: it gets the job done, but you’re missing out on *feel*, *function*, and *fun*.

Customizing your board lets you:

- Improve typing **comfort** and ergonomics (no more cramped fingers or weird wrist angles)
- Create a satisfying **sound and feel** that actually makes typing enjoyable
- Boost **durability** with high-quality components that last
- Express **your personality** through color, style, and layout choices

Whether it’s the silky smooth feel of linear switches or the crisp click of tactile ones — once you try a custom board,
it’s hard to go back.

> “Typing on a good board is like using a fine instrument. It just *feels* right.”

## ⚙️ What Can You Customize?

Here's where the fun begins. Mechanical keyboards are made of **modular parts**, and that means you can build yours from
the ground up.

### 🧷 Switches

- **Linear**: Smooth keystrokes with no bump (e.g., Gateron Yellows, Oil Kings)
- **Tactile**: A small bump mid-press for feedback (e.g., Holy Pandas)
- **Clicky**: Tactile *and* loud (e.g., Cherry MX Blues)

Lube them if you want a smoother feel and less scratch.

### 🎨 Keycaps

- Choose between **ABS** (lighter, often shinier) and **PBT** (thicker, more durable).
- Profile matters too — SA, DSA, Cherry, XDA. Each has a different height and feel.

Want to get nerdy? Try dye-sub PBT caps or themed artisan caps for that extra flair.

### 🧱 Layout

Pick the form that suits your workflow:

- **60%**: Minimal, portable, no arrow/function keys
- **65%**: Compact but keeps arrows (my fave)
- **75%**: Everything you need in a tight space
- **TKL or Full-size**: More keys = more control

Some even build **Alice or split ergonomic layouts** — they look odd but can help with strain.

### 🏗️ Case and Plate

- **Acrylic** = clean and light
- **Aluminum** = hefty and premium
- **Gasket-mounted** = softer typing experience
- **Top/Bottom-mount** = firmer and snappier

Every build affects how the board sounds and feels. That’s the beauty of it.

## 🧪 My Current Setup

Right now, I’m rocking a **65% gasket-mounted board**:

- **Switches**: Lubed Gateron Oil Kings (super smooth and quiet)
- **Keycaps**: SA Profile PBT in a muted gray/pink colorway
- **Case**: Clear stacked acrylic with underglow
- **Plate**: FR4 — flexible, dampens harsh clacks
- **Mods**: Tape mod, PE foam, and silicone dampeners for that perfect “thock”

Typing on it feels like pressing little clouds.

---

## 🔊 Sound Profiles Matter

Yes, sound is part of the appeal too.

Want it deep and muted? Go for lubed linears with a soft plate and foam.  
Want it loud and clicky? Tactiles or clicky switches on a metal plate will do the trick.

You can even tune stabilizers (for long keys like spacebar) to avoid rattle.

---

## 🧠 The Learning Curve

Custom boards have a learning curve — especially when it comes to:

- Soldering (for non-hot-swappable PCBs)
- Switch lubing and filming
- Stabilizer tuning
- Layout programming (via QMK/VIA)

But the community is massive, and tutorials are everywhere.  
Reddit, YouTube, Discord — you’ll always find someone willing to help.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Custom keyboards aren't just a hobby — they’re an upgrade to your **daily workflow** and your **joy while typing**.

If you're going to type for hours a day, why not make every keystroke feel amazing?
